# Win32-GUI-Test2
A Test/Example of a Win32 graphic user interface application using the resources of MinGW64. 
I tested it on Windows 10 x64, Windows XP x64 and Windows XP x86. I don't know if it will run on Windows 11.

This code is an "upgrade" of "Win32-GUI-Test". An alternative way of doing the same thing.

I made this code just for fun. Don't expect professional performance from it.
